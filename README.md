# APIFramework_Xendit-Challenge
Please Have a Look at README file for More details

I have created a API Automation Framework using BDD Cucumber with JAVA.

1) The BDD framework will have the steps as 1) Feature file 2) Step Implementation File 3) Runner File.

2) The feature file will have the Test Steps to Perform Testing, in another words these are the Manual Test Cases which are developed in a plain english
   sentences with Gherkin Systanxs.

3) Step Implementation file contains the java code which will be the working code to implement the steps in Feature file.

4) Runner File will contains the different Options to configure the location of feature files and Step Implementation ( Glue Code ) and the options for Reports
   generation and Option for Re Run the failed Scenarios.

5) We can generate neat Html reports using Extent Reports ( a third party libs which will help us to generate the reports ) instead of normal Json Reports.

6) We can run the Cucumber Frame work using Unit Test Frameworks like Junit or Testng.

7) The whole project is based on Maven for easy catching the dependencies.
